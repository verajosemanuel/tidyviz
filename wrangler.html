   <td style="text-align:left;"> Amelia </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A tool that &quot;multiply imputes&quot; missing data in a single cross-section
  (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for
  each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data
  set (such as collected by years for each of several countries).
  Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
  essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
  is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
  handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
  rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
  let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
  generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
  that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
  of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
  diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program
  works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that
  does not require users to know R. </td>

The author's intention was to create a toolbox, which facilitates the (notoriously time consuming) first descriptive tasks in data analysis, consisting of calculating descriptive statistics, drawing graphical summaries and reporting the results. The package contains furthermore functions to produce documents using MS Word (or PowerPoint) and functions to import data from Excel. Many of the included functions can be found scattered in other packages and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned. Google style guides were used as naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives). The 'camel style' was consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed R packages as well. </td>

   Matches and back references are input to the replacement function and 
   replaced by the function output.   gsubfn can be used to split strings 
   based on content rather than delimiters and for quasi-perl-style string 
   interpolation. The package also has facilities for translating formulas 
   to functions and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of

    tables and crosstabs); and isolate duplicate records. Other janitor functions
    nicely format the tabulation results. These tabulate-and-report functions
    approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel. This package
    follows the principles of the &quot;tidyverse&quot; and works well with the pipe function

        a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can be used to
        impute continuous and/or categorical data including complex
        interactions and non-linear relations. It yields an out-of-bag
        (OOB) imputation error estimate without the need of a test set

Item Response Theory is done using  factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data at multiple levels include within and between group statistics, including correlations and factor analysis.   Functions for simulating and testing particular item and test structures are included. Several functions  serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometric theory as well as publications in personality research.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Collection of convenient functions for common statistical computations,
             which are not directly provided by R's base or stats packages.
             This package aims at providing, first, shortcuts for statistical
             measures, which otherwise could only be calculated with additional
             effort (like standard errors or root mean squared errors). Second,
             these shortcut functions are generic (if appropriate), and can be
             applied not only to vectors, but also to other objects as well
             (e.g., the Coefficient of Variation can be computed for vectors,
             linear models, or linear mixed models; the r2()-function returns
             the r-squared value for 'lm', 'glm', 'merMod' or 'lme' objects).
             The focus of most functions lies on summary statistics or fit
             measures for regression models, including generalized linear
             models and mixed effects models. However, some of the functions
             also deal with other statistical measures, like Cronbach's Alpha,

    and MCMC diagnostics. The package is designed not only to provide convenient
    functionality for users, but also a common set of functions that can be
    easily used by developers working on a variety of R packages for Bayesian
    modeling, particularly (but not exclusively) packages interfacing with 'Stan'. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Estimates previously compiled regression models using the 'rstan' package,
    which provides the R interface to the Stan C++ library for Bayesian estimation.
    Users specify models via the customary R syntax with a formula and data.frame
    plus some additional arguments for priors. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> rstantools </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Provides various tools for developers of R packages interfacing
    with 'Stan' &lt;http://mc-stan.org&gt;, including functions to set up the required 
    package structure, S3 generics and default methods to unify function naming 
    across 'Stan'-based R packages, and a vignette with recommendations for 
    developers. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A graphical user interface for interactive Markov chain Monte
    Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics and plots and tables helpful for analyzing a
    posterior sample. The interface is powered by the 'Shiny' web
    application framework from 'RStudio' and works with the output of MCMC 
    programs written in any programming language (and has extended 
    functionality for 'Stan' models fit using the 'rstan' and 'rstanarm' 
    packages). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> brms </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multilevel models 
    using Stan for full Bayesian inference. A wide range of distributions 
    and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit -- among others -- 
    linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, 
    zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a 
    multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and 
    smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic 
    standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the 
    response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional 
    regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage 
    users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.
    Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive 
    checks and leave-one-out cross-validation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Provides functionality for client-side navigation of
    the server side file system in shiny apps. In case the app is running
    locally this gives the user direct access to the file system without the
    need to &quot;download&quot; files to a temporary location. Both file and folder
    selection as well as file saving is available. </td>

    greatly improve your apps without having to know any JavaScript. Examples
    include: hiding an element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to
    its original value, delaying code execution by a few seconds, and many more
    useful functions for both the end user and the developer. 'shinyjs' can also
    be used to easily call your own custom JavaScript functions from R. </td>
