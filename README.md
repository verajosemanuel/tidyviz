[tidyviz](https://hub.docker.com/r/jvera/tidyviz)            |  Adds reporting & interactive charts packages   |[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/jvera/tidyviz.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/jvera/tidyviz "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")| [![](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jvera/tidyviz.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jvera/tidyviz) | [![](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/jvera/tidyviz.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jvera/tidyviz/builds)

base is jvera/tidyviz-base 

Added packages:

- report specific (rmdformats, tufte, prettydoc, rticles, printR...)
- visualization (ggvis, leaflet, ggThemeAssist, ggthemes...)
- imputation and assertions (mice, validate, VIM, assertive, tester...)
- interactive graphics (highcharter, plotly, DiagrammeR...)
- text analytics (tidytext, textclean, wordcloud, topicmodels...)
- machine learning (randomForest, caret, party, e1071, gbm ...)


Suitable for sharing ·even· prettier analysis and reproducibility.

## Quick Reference

Pull the image from repo:

```bash
docker pull jvera/tidyviz:latest
```
Then build a container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 jvera/tidyviz
```

Connect to port 8787 with your browser (rstudio as user and password) to check if your Rserver is up and running.
By default, the RStudio user does not have access to root, such that users cannot install binary libraries with apt-get without first entering the container. To enable root from within RStudio, launch the container with the flag -e ROOT=TRUE, e.g.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE jvera/tidyviz
```
You can now open a shell from RStudio (see the "Tools" menu), or directly from the R console using system(), e.g.

```bash
system("sudo apt-get install -y vim")
```

When container is built you can start it with:

```bash
docker start mycontainer --interactive /bin/bash
```

### Sharing data with host:

```bash
docker start mycontainer --interactive -v ~/dockerdata:/data /bin/bash
```

Any file you place there, will be available for the container to use, and vice versa. Maybe you need a Shiny Server, so run a Dockerized Shiny and share the same folder so you can develop your viz in Rstudio and serve with Shiny.

|Amelia                     |A Program for Missing Data                                                                                                                               |A tool that "multiply imputes" missing data in a single cross-section
  (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for
  each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data
  set (such as collected by years for each of several countries).
  Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
  essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
  is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
  handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
  rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
  let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
  generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
  that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
  of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
  diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program
  works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that
  does not require users to know R.                                                                            |http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia                                                                                                                                 |

  purchase behavior in a non-contractual setting. It uses historic transaction records to fit a
  probabilistic model, which then allows to compute quantities of managerial interest on a cohort-

  package complements the BTYD package by providing several additional buy-till-you-die models, that
  have been published in the marketing literature, but whose implementation are complex and non-trivial.
  These models are: NBD, MBG/NBD, BG/CNBD-k, MBG/CNBD-k, Pareto/NBD (HB), Pareto/NBD (Abe) and Pareto/GGG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |https://github.com/mplatzer/BTYDplus#readme                                                                                                                     |

    robust against overfitting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |NA                                                                                                                                                              |

|gsubfn                     |Utilities for strings and function arguments                                                                                                             |gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function
   or certain other objects instead of the replacement string.
   Matches and back references are input to the replacement function and 
   replaced by the function output.   gsubfn can be used to split strings 
   based on content rather than delimiters and for quasi-perl-style string 
   interpolation. The package also has facilities for translating formulas 
   to functions and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of 
   functions.  This can be used with R functions such as apply, sapply,
   lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot, Filter and any other function that 
   expects another function as an input argument or functions like cat
   or sql calls that may involve strings where substitution is desirable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |http://gsubfn.googlecode.com                                                                                                                                    |

    alone HTML file, embedded in 'R Markdown' documents or in a 'Shiny' app, and
    available in the 'RStudio' viewer pane. Hover the mouse pointer over a cell to
    show details or drag a rectangle to zoom. A 'heatmap' is a popular graphical
    method for visualizing high-dimensional data, in which a table of numbers
    are encoded as a grid of colored cells. The rows and columns of the matrix
    are ordered to highlight patterns and are often accompanied by 'dendrograms'.
    'Heatmaps' are used in many fields for visualizing observations, correlations,
    missing values patterns, and more. Interactive 'heatmaps' allow the inspection
    of specific value by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into
    a region of the 'heatmap' by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area.
    This work is based on the 'ggplot2' and 'plotly.js' engine. It produces
    similar 'heatmaps' as 'heatmap.2' or 'd3heatmap', with the advantage of speed
    ('plotly.js' is able to handle larger size matrix), the ability to zoom from
    the 'dendrogram' panes, and the placing of factor variables in the sides of the
    'heatmap'. |https://cran.r-project.org/package=heatmaply,

    implemented by the MICE algorithm as described in Van Buuren and 
    Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v045.i03>. Each variable has 
    its own imputation model. Built-in imputation models are provided for 
    continuous data (predictive mean matching, normal), binary data (logistic 
    regression), unordered categorical data (polytomous logistic regression) 
    and ordered categorical data (proportional odds). MICE can also impute 
    continuous two-level data (normal model, pan, second-level variables). 
    Passive imputation can be used to maintain consistency between variables.

    imputations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |http://www.stefvanbuuren.nl , http://www.multiple-imputation.com                                                                                                |

        impute missing values particularly in the case of mixed-type

        a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can be used to
        impute continuous and/or categorical data including complex
        interactions and non-linear relations. It yields an out-of-bag
        (OOB) imputation error estimate without the need of a test set

  The core of the package is ctree(), an implementation of
  conditional inference trees which embed tree-structured 
  regression models into a well defined theory of conditional
  inference procedures. This non-parametric class of regression
  trees is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including
  nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response
  variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. 
  Based on conditional inference trees, cforest() provides an
  implementation of Breiman's random forests. The function mob()
  implements an algorithm for recursive partitioning based on
  parametric models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or survival
  regression) employing parameter instability tests for split
  selection. Extensible functionality for visualizing tree-structured
  regression models is available. The methods are described in

Functions are primarily for multivariate analysis and scale construction using factor analysis, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done using  factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data at multiple levels include within and between group statistics, including correlations and factor analysis.   Functions for simulating and testing particular item and test structures are included. Several functions  serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometric theory as well as publications in personality research.

 'Eigen' is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors,
 numerical solvers and related algorithms.  It supports dense and sparse
 matrices on integer, floating point and complex numbers, decompositions of
 such matrices, and solutions of linear systems. Its performance on many
 algorithms is comparable with some of the best implementations based on
 'Lapack' and level-3 'BLAS'. The 'RcppEigen' package includes the header
 files from the 'Eigen' C++ template library (currently version 3.3.3). Thus
 users do not need to install 'Eigen' itself in order to use 'RcppEigen'.

 (version 2); earlier version were licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3 or
 later. 'RcppEigen' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Eigen') is licensed under

There is a shared object containing part of the 'CVODES' library, but it is not accessible from R. 'StanHeaders' is only useful for developers who want to utilize the 'LinkingTo' directive of their package's DESCRIPTION file to build on the Stan library without incurring unnecessary dependencies. The Stan project develops a probabilistic programming language that implements full or approximate Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo or 'variational' methods and implements (optionally penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via optimization. The Stan library includes an advanced automatic differentiation scheme, 'templated' statistical and linear algebra functions that can handle the automatically 'differentiable' scalar types (and doubles, 'ints', etc.), and a parser for the Stan language. The 'rstan' package provides user-facing R functions to parse, compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models.                                                                                                                                                   |http://mc-stan.org/                                                                                                                                             |

    the missing and/or imputed values. Depending on this structure of the missing
    values, the corresponding methods may help to identify the mechanism generating
    the missing values and allows to explore the data including missing values.
    In addition, the quality of imputation can be visually explored using various
    univariate, bivariate, multiple and multivariate plot methods. A graphical user
    interface available in the separate package VIMGUI allows an easy handling of

The editor registers itself as a reactive Shiny input, so the current value of the editor can easily be pulled from server.R using input$yourEditorsName.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |https://github.com/trestletech/shinyAce                                                                                                                         |

All credits goes to the original developers.
      The purpose of lime is to explain the predictions of black box classifiers. What this means is that for any given prediction and any given classifier it is able to determine a small set of features in the original data that has driven the outcome of the prediction.
