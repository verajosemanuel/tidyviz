"alphahull","Generalization of the Convex Hull of a Sample of Points in the
Plane","Computation of the alpha-shape and alpha-convex
        hull of a given sample of points in the plane. The concepts of
        alpha-shape and alpha-convex hull generalize the definition of
        the convex hull of a finite set of points. The programming is
        based on the duality between the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay
        triangulation. The package also includes a function that
        returns the Delaunay mesh of a given sample of points and its
        dual Voronoi diagram in one single object.",NA,"2.1","2016-02-10","Color"
"Amelia","A Program for Missing Data","A tool that ""multiply imputes"" missing data in a single cross-section
  (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for
  each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data
  set (such as collected by years for each of several countries).
  Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
  essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
  is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
  handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
  rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
  let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
  generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
  that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
  of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
  diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program
  works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that
  does not require users to know R.","http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia","1.7.5","2018-05-07","Imputation"

"anomalize","Tidy Anomaly Detection","
    The 'anomalize' package enables a ""tidy"" workflow for detecting anomalies in data.
    The main functions are time_decompose(), anomalize(), and time_recompose().
    When combined, it's quite simple to decompose time series, detect anomalies,
    and create bands separating the ""normal"" data from the anomalous data at scale (i.e. for multiple time series). 
    Time series decomposition is used to remove trend and seasonal components via the time_decompose() function
    and methods include seasonal decomposition of time series by Loess (""stl"") and 
    seasonal decomposition by piecewise medians (""twitter""). The anomalize() function implements
    two methods for anomaly detection of residuals including using an inner quartile range (""iqr"")
    and generalized extreme studentized deviation (""gesd""). These methods are based on
    those used in the 'forecast' package and the Twitter 'AnomalyDetection' package.

"archivist","Tools for Storing, Restoring and Searching for R Objects","Data exploration and modelling is a process in which a lot of data
    artifacts are produced. Artifacts like: subsets, data aggregates, plots,
    statistical models, different versions of data sets and different versions
    of results. The more projects we work with the more artifacts are produced
    and the harder it is to manage these artifacts. Archivist helps to store
    and manage artifacts created in R. Archivist allows you to store selected
    artifacts as a binary files together with their metadata and relations.
    Archivist allows to share artifacts with others, either through shared
    folder or github. Archivist allows to look for already created artifacts by
    using it's class, name, date of the creation or other properties. Makes it
    easy to restore such artifacts. Archivist allows to check if new artifact
    is the exact copy that was produced some time ago. That might be useful

    linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, 
    zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a 
    multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and 
    smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic 
    standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the 
    response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional 
    regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage 
    users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.
    Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive 
    checks and leave-one-out cross-validation. References: Bürkner (2017)

    of specific value by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into
    a region of the 'heatmap' by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area.

    similar 'heatmaps' as 'heatmap.2' or 'd3heatmap', with the advantage of speed

Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.
	Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. 
	A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above.
	Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection (sdr).
