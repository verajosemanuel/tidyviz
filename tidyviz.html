   <td style="text-align:left;"> antiword </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wraps the 'AntiWord' utility to extract text from Microsoft
    Word documents. The utility only supports the old 'doc' format, not the 
    new xml based 'docx' format. Use the 'xml2' package to read the latter. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Amelia </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A tool that &quot;multiply imputes&quot; missing data in a single cross-section
  (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for
  each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data
  set (such as collected by years for each of several countries).
  Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
  essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
  is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
  handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
  rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
  let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
  generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
  that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
  of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
  diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program
  works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that
  does not require users to know R. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> afex </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Convenience functions for analyzing factorial experiments using ANOVA or

          ANOVAs for data in long format (i.e., one observation per row), aggregating
          multiple observations per individual and cell of the design. mixed() fits mixed
          models using lme4::lmer() and computes p-values for all fixed effects using
          either Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom (LMM
          only), parametric bootstrap (LMMs and GLMMs), or likelihood ratio tests (LMMs
          and GLMMs). afex uses type 3 sums of squares as default (imitating commercial
          statistical software). </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> checkpoint </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package
    reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install packages
    as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time
    machine. To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function installs the
    packages required or called by your project and scripts to a local library
    exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only those packages
    are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
    later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's
    checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any
    time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
    refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the &quot;Microsoft R Archived Network&quot;
    server (&lt;https://mran.microsoft.com/&gt;). Immediately after completion
    of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot, thus creating the

   <td style="text-align:left;"> CRANsearcher </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> One of the strengths of R is its vast package ecosystem. Indeed, R packages extend from visualization to Bayesian inference and from spatial analyses to pharmacokinetics (&lt;https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/&gt;). There is probably not an area of quantitative research that isn't represented by at least one R package. At the time of this writing, there are more than 10,000 active CRAN packages. Because of this massive ecosystem, it is important to have tools to search and learn about packages related to your personal R needs. For this reason, we developed an RStudio addin capable of searching available CRAN packages directly within RStudio. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> DescTools </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A collection of miscellaneous basic statistic functions and convenience wrappers for efficiently describing data. The author's intention was to create a toolbox, which facilitates the (notoriously time consuming) first descriptive tasks in data analysis, consisting of calculating descriptive statistics, drawing graphical summaries and reporting the results. The package contains furthermore functions to produce documents using MS Word (or PowerPoint) and functions to import data from Excel. Many of the included functions can be found scattered in other packages and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned. Google style guides were used as naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives). The 'camel style' was consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed R packages as well. </td>

             This package aims at providing, first, shortcuts for statistical
             measures, which otherwise could only be calculated with additional
             effort (like standard errors or root mean squared errors). Second,
             these shortcut functions are generic (if appropriate), and can be
             applied not only to vectors, but also to other objects as well
             (e.g., the Coefficient of Variation can be computed for vectors,
             linear models, or linear mixed models; the r2()-function returns
             the r-squared value for 'lm', 'glm', 'merMod' or 'lme' objects).
             The focus of most functions lies on summary statistics or fit
             measures for regression models, including generalized linear
             models and mixed effects models. However, some of the functions

    show details or drag a rectangle to zoom. A 'heatmap' is a popular graphical
    method for visualizing high-dimensional data, in which a table of numbers
    are encoded as a grid of colored cells. The rows and columns of the matrix
    are ordered to highlight patterns and are often accompanied by 'dendrograms'.
    'Heatmaps' are used in many fields for visualizing observations, correlations,
    missing values patterns, and more. Interactive 'heatmaps' allow the inspection
    of specific value by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into
    a region of the 'heatmap' by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area.
    This work is based on the 'ggplot2' and 'plotly.js' engine. It produces
    similar 'heatmaps' as 'heatmap.2' or 'd3heatmap', with the advantage of speed
    ('plotly.js' is able to handle larger size matrix), the ability to zoom from

    linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, 
    zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a 
    multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and 
    smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic 
    standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the 
    response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional 
    regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage 
    users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.
    Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive 
    checks and leave-one-out cross-validation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> spatstat </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Comprehensive open-source toolbox for analysing Spatial Point Patterns. Focused mainly on two-dimensional point patterns, including multitype/marked points, in any spatial region. Also supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-time point patterns in any number of dimensions, point patterns on a linear network, and patterns of other geometrical objects. Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel images. 
	Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference. 
	Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and linear networks. 
	Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.
	Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. 
	A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above.
	Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots. </td>
