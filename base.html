   <td style="text-align:left;"> checkpoint </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package
    reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install packages
    as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time
    machine. To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function installs the
    packages required or called by your project and scripts to a local library
    exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only those packages
    are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
    later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's
    checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any
    time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
    refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the &quot;Microsoft R Archived Network&quot;
    server (&lt;https://mran.microsoft.com/&gt;). Immediately after completion
    of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot, thus creating the
    archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from 2014-09-17. </td>

    Second, users are given more control over the identification of header and body
    rows which will end up in the R table, including semantic header information
    that appear throughout the body. Third, the function preprocesses table code,

    types. When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R
    types. Compatible with all versions of Python &gt;= 2.7. </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> rio </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Streamlined data import and export by making assumptions that
    the user is probably willing to make: 'import()' and 'export()' determine
    the data structure from the file extension, reasonable defaults are used for
    data import and export (e.g., 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'), web-based import is
    natively supported (including from SSL/HTTPS), compressed files can be read
    directly without explicit decompression, and fast import packages are used where
    appropriate. An additional convenience function, 'convert()', provides a simple
    method for converting between file types. </td>

    regular file. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The 'tidyverse' is a set of packages that work in harmony
    because they share common data representations and 'API' design. This
    package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple
    'tidyverse' packages in a single step. Learn more about the 'tidyverse'

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> tidyxl </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Imports non-tabular from Excel files into R.  Exposes cell content,
    position and formatting in a tidy structure for further manipulation.
    Provides functions for selecting cells by position and relative position,
    and for associating data cells with header cells by proximity in given
    directions.  Supports '.xlsx' and '.xlsm' via the embedded 'RapidXML' C++
    library &lt;http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net&gt;.  Does not support '.xlsb' or
    '.xls'. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> unrtf </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wraps the 'unrtf' utility to extract text from RTF files. Supports
    document conversion to HTML, LaTeX or plain text. Output in HTML is recommended
    because 'unrtf' has limited support for converting between character encodings. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> validate </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Declare data validation rules and data quality indicators; confront
    data with them and analyze or visualize the results. The package supports
    rules that are per-field, in-record, cross-record or cross-dataset. Rules
    can be automatically analyzed for rule type and connectivity. </td>
